  "NL": "If an investor holds a fixed income security like a bond or a certificate of deposit, then they can expect to earn a return called yield, which is calculated as a percentage of the security's face or par value. The yield is determined by dividing the annual interest payments (or coupon) by the current market price of the security. For example, if a bond with a face value of $1,000 yields annual coupons of $50 and is trading at $950, the yield would be approximately 5.26% ($50 / $950). Furthermore, this yield can manifest in various forms depending on specific conditions:\n\n1. If only the annual interest payment and the current market price are considered, then the yield calculated is the current yield.\n2. If the calculation also includes potential capital gains or losses through to the maturity date of the bond, then the yield expressed is the yield to maturity (YTM).\n3. If the bond has a call option and the calculation assumes the bond is redeemed at the earliest possible date, then the yield derived is the yield to call (YTC).\n4. If all possible early redemption scenarios are considered to determine the lowest possible yield that can be received, then this is referred to as the yield to worst (YTW).\n\nThese calculations of yield are essential for investors to compare different fixed income securities and to ascertain the attractiveness of an investment relative to its risk, where generally, a higher yield signifies higher risks due to the increased return demanded by investors for taking on more risk.",

  "NL": "**Rule:**\n\nIf an individual or entity seeks to either speculate on future asset pricing, hedge against potential financial losses, or generate additional income through the management of investment risks, then they might engage in practicing Options Theory, which encompasses the analysis and application of financial derivatives called options. These options grant the holder the right—but not the obligation—to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) by a certain date (referred to as the expiration date). \n\nOptions come in two primary forms:\n- **Call options**, which allow the purchaser to buy the underlying asset at the strike price until the expiration date.\n- **Put options**, which allow the purchaser to sell the underlying asset at the strike price until the expiration date.\n\nFor call options, if the market price of the underlying asset surpasses the strike price, the holder may exercise this option to buy at the lower price, potentially gaining profits. Conversely, if the market value remains below the strike price, the buyer may let the call option expire, limitedly losing the initially paid premium.\n\nFor put options, if the market price of the underlying asset drops below the strike price, the holder may exercise this option to sell at the higher price, potentially gaining profits. If the market value stays above the strike price, the buyer may let the put option expire, similarly losing only the paid premium.\n\nThe valuation of these options (call and put) is influenced by several factors, including: \n- The current market price of the underlying asset.\n- The time duration until the option's expiration.\n- The underlying asset's volatility.\n- The prevailing risk-free interest rate.\n\nA vital component of Options Theory is the Black-Scholes model, a mathematical model used to price options by considering these factors. Additionally, Options Theory examines various option-based trading strategies, such as covered calls, protective puts, straddles, and spreads, which can be utilized to manage investments and navigate financial markets effectively.",
  "FOL": "To transform the theorem related to Options Theory into First Order Logic (FOL), we'll start by identifying key concepts and relationships expressed in the description, and then symbolizing these using logical predicates and functions.

This level would require an extended formal system possibly integrating calculus elements which can be complex to represent in straightforward FOL.\n\nThis transformation captures basic logical relationships described in the Options Theory synopsis, with a focus on their structural and functional attributes rather than deep mathematical detail. To fully describe theories like the Black-Scholes model in FOL, more sophisticated mathematical logic frameworks might be necessary.\n"

We'll also use functions to indicate properties such as the wage rate, population size, etc. We need to ensure each statement captures the dependence on various factors.\n\nHere is how you might formalize parts of the theorem in First Order Logic:\n\n### Basic Predicates & Functions\n- `Work(x)` : Individual x is working.\n- `Willing(x)` : Individual x is willing to work.\n- `Able(x)` : Individual x is able to work.\n- `LaborSupply(L, e)` : L is the labor supply in economy e.\n- `Population(p, e)` : p is the population size of economy e.\n- `WageRate(w, e)` : w is the wage rate in economy e.\n- `HigherEducation(x)` : Individual x has a higher education level.\n\n### Labor Supply Definition\n1. `LaborSupply(L, e) ↔ ∀x (x ∈ L ↔ (Willing(x) ∧ Able(x) ∧ x ∈ e))`\n   - This states that the labor supply L in economy e is composed of individuals x who are willing and able to work and are part of economy e.\n\n### Influencing Factors\n#### Population Size\n2. `∀e ∀p1 ∀p2 (Population(p1, e) ∧ Population(p2, e) ∧ p1 > p2 → |LaborSupply(L1,e)| > |LaborSupply(L2,e)|) ∧ p1 > p2`\n   - If the population p1 is greater than p2 in the same economy e, then the labor supply L1 from p1 is larger than L2 from p2.\n\n#### Demographics\n3. `∀x ∀e (Older(x) ∧ x ∈ e → ¬Able(x))`\n   - If individual x is older and part of economy e, they are typically not able to work (representing retirement).\n\n4. `∀x (HigherEducation(x) → Able(x))`\n   - If individual x has a higher level of education, this implies they are able to perform skilled labor.\n\n#### Wage Rates\n5. `∀w1 ∀w2 ∀e (WageRate(w1, e) ∧ WageRate(w2, e) ∧ w1 > w2 → ∀x (Willing(x) ∧ WageRate(w1, e) → Willing(x) ∧ WageRate(w2, e)))`\n   - If the wage rate w1 is higher than w2 in economy e, anyone willing to work at w2 is also willing to work at w1.\n\n#### Non-wage factors\n6. `∀x (FavorableConditions(x) → Willing(x))`\n   - If individual x has favorable non-wage working conditions, they are more likely to be willing to work.\n\nThese logical statements capture the main concepts of the theorem in terms of individual willingness, ability, and the operational definition of labor supply. The exact formulations could be further refined or expanded based on additional details or specific applications in economics."

This involves setting the foundations and prerequisites of the theorem into logical statements:\n\n1. **Definition of Original and Target Cube**: Define the volumes of the original and new cube.\n\n2. **Relationship Between the Volumes**: The volume of the new cube should be twice that of the original cube.\n\n3. **Mathematical Expression of the Relationship**: This involves expressing the requirement for the side lengths and volumes in a formal logic way.\n\n4. **Constructibility Restriction**: Express the restriction that a certain type of operation (using only compass and straightedge) cannot achieve the necessary outcome (creating the second cube of the certain volume).\n\nLet's express these considerations in FOL:\n\n1. Let \\( a \\) be a real number representing the side length of the original cube, and \\( b \\) be a real number representing the side length of the desired cube. Let \\( V(x) \\) denote the volume of a cube with side length \\( x \\).\n\n2. \\( V(a) = a^3 \\) - Define the volume of the original cube.\n3. \\( V(b) = b^3 \\) - Define the volume of the new cube.\n4.

  "FOL": "To express the inclusion-exclusion principle using First Order Logic (FOL), we need to translate the operations and the relationships involving sets and their elements into logical expressions. The principle uses cardinalities of sets, intersections, and unions. Here, we will translate the expression concerning the cardinalities to FOL predicates and functions while ensuring that the principle applies to any number of sets.\n\nFirst, let us translate basic elements and operations:\n- Let \\(|A|\\) be represented as `|A|` which is a function that returns the cardinality of set A.\n- Let \\(A \\cup B\\) be expressed as `Union(A,B)`, which is a function that returns the union of sets A and B.\n- Let \\(A \\cap B\\) be expressed as `Intersect(A,B)`, which is a function that returns the intersection of sets A and B.\n- Let \\(x \\in A\\) be represented in FOL as `In(x,A)`, which states that element x is a member of set A.\n\n### FOL Representation of Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\nWe first describe the principle for two and three sets explicitly and then generalize for n sets using recursion and summation.\n\n#### Two Sets\nFor two sets A and B, the principle states:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\]\nIn FOL, this can be written as:\n\\[ |Union(A, B)| = |A| + |B| - |Intersect(A, B)| \\]\n\n#### Three Sets\nFor three sets A, B, and C, the formula is a bit more complex:\n\\[ |A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C| \\]\nWritten in FOL:\n\\[ |Union(Union(A, B), C)| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |Intersect(A, B)| - |Intersect(A, C)| - |Intersect(B, C)| + |Intersect(Intersect(A, B), C)| \\]\n\n#### Generalization to n Sets\nFor a generalized version, let us use an index set \\( I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., n\\} \\) to indicate subsets of indices, and let \\(\\mathcal{P}(n)\\) be the power set of \\(\\{1,2,...,n\\}\\), excluding the empty set. We introduce a function `cardinalityOfUnion(indexSet)`, which computes the cardinality of the union of the sets indexed by elements in indexSet.\n\n\\[ |Union(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n)| = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} \\sum_{\\substack{J \\subseteq \\{1,2,...,n\\}\\\\|J|=k}} |\\bigcap_{j \\in J} A_j| \\]\n\nExpressed recursively, this might involve defining functions for intersections across subset indices and summing them with appropriate signs, managing the complexities of expressing summation and indexing in standard FOL. A compact expression in predicate logic might need extensions or an understanding that some functional constructs like summation over sets are given logically outside the pure first-order framework.\n\nThis expression gives a top level snapshot of translating the inclusion-exclusion principle to FOL, assuming capabilities for handling cardinalities, union and intersection in the logic system used. Keep in mind that a full implementation expressive enough for practical purposes might need either higher-order logic or non-logical axioms and definitions handling sets, arithmetic, and indexing."

We will also need a binary predicate to express the relation that a pigeon is in a pigeonhole, for which we can use `I(x, y)` meaning \"pigeon x is in pigeonhole y\".\n\nThe primary statement of the Pigeonhole Principle asserts that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain at least two pigeons.

The formula thus expresses that if the number of objects exceeds the number of containers, some container must contain at least two of these objects."
