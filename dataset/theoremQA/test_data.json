It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. Silver iodide particles that are not illuminated and vacant portions of the film remain blank. We make the following assumptions: We grid the film very finely into cells of area $dA$. It is assumed that there is at most one silver iodide particle per cell and that no silver iodide particle is intersected by the cell boundaries.
